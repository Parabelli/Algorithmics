You ask 2 string to the user in the console and you concatenate them

\--

This code prompts the user to input two `phrases` through the command line, concatenates them with a space in between, and logs the result to the console. It uses the built-in `readline` module and its `createInterface` method to read input from `process.stdin` and write output to `process.stdout`, and then closes the interface with `rl.close()`.

5        output: process.stdout,
6      });

8      rl.question("first phrase : ", (phrase1) => {
9        rl.question("second phrase : ", (phrase2) => {
10         var conc = phrase1 + " " + phrase2;
11         console.log(conc);

This code snippet uses the `readline` module to create an interface that prompts the user to enter a price and a VAT percentage. It then calculates the price with VAT and logs the result to the console. Finally, it closes the interface.
